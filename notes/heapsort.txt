Heapsort
----------------------------------
for (int k = N/2; k >= 1; k--){
	sink(a, k, N)
}

while (N > 1){
	exch(a, 1, N)
	sink(a, 1, --N)
}

Sorting
	- N log N

Construction
	- uses N

Heapsort optimal for time and space BUT:
	- inner loop longer than quicksort's
	- make poor use of cache memory (bouncing between index positions)
	- not stable
